\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overview and purpose of the application}
\textbf{Observa} is a cutting-edge application designed to provide users with real-time surveillance and monitoring of the doorway to their homes. The primary purpose of the app is to enhance security and convenience for homeowners by leveraging advanced technology such as computer vision and facial recognition. Here are the key features and aspects of \textbf{Observa}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Live Stream Monitoring:} \textbf{Observa} offers a live stream of the doorway, allowing users to monitor activities in real time. This can be particularly useful for keeping track of visitors, deliveries, or any unexpected events.
    
    \item \textbf{Facial Recognition and Visitor Labeling:} The app incorporates a sophisticated facial recognition system. Users have the ability to add known visitors to a database. When a recognized person approaches the door, \textbf{Observa} labels them, providing instant information about their identity.
    
    \item \textbf{Historical Visitor Log:} \textbf{Observa} maintains a comprehensive log of all past visitors, complete with timestamps and identified individuals. This feature allows users to review who has visited their home over time, providing an added layer of security and awareness.
    
    \item \textbf{Photo Upload for Visitor Database:} Users can upload photos of their known visitors, creating a personalized contact list. This enhances the accuracy of the facial recognition system and ensures that users receive accurate and detailed information about who is at their doorstep.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Goals And Objectives}
The objective of \textbf{Observa} is to maintain home-security by developing a smart doorbell system. The system leverages facial recognition feature that notifies the clients whether they are familiar with this person or he is not one of their usual visitors. Streaming and observing the door-way to ensure clients' in-home safety from burglars or undesired visitors. What stimulates the project is the need for more secure and convenient home security solutions. The expected outcome is the creation of a user-friendly, efficient, and effective smart doorbell system that enhances residential security. Existing systems are often expensive, difficult to install and lack advanced features such as face recognition. Besides, such systems are not applicable or available in the middle east. Our system's utility lies in providing homeowners' with real-time access to their doorstep.\
\subsection{Target audience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Homeowners and Families:} Observa is ideal for homeowners and families who want to enhance the security of their homes and keep track of who comes and goes. It provides peace of mind by offering real-time monitoring and historical data on visitors.
    
    \item \textbf{Security-Conscious Individuals:} People who prioritize security and want a reliable system to monitor their home entrance will find Observa valuable. This includes individuals living in various types of residential settings, from houses to apartments.
    
    \item \textbf{Busy Professionals and Parents:} Observa caters to individuals with busy lifestyles, such as professionals and parents, who may not always be physically present at home. The app allows them to stay connected and informed about activities at their doorstep, even when they are away.
    
    \item \textbf{Tech Enthusiasts:} Those who appreciate the integration of advanced technologies like facial recognition and real-time streaming in their daily lives may be drawn to Observa. The app combines innovation with practical utility.
\end{itemize}

\section{Key Functionalities}
In out project, the main goal is to provide users with interactive websites that enables them access all the features they demand, based on our previous market research and interviews. All the features included in the following subsections are ones that either facilitate interaction with our environment or add functionalities to our whole program development.
\subsection{Home Page}
We display a home page that acts as a representative of our services to new users who would like to check the application and still not yet decided to subscribe and give it a try. It redirects users to signup or login if they are interested.
\subsection{Sign-up}
Users must have an account with specific minimum data in order to subscribe to our service, this data include basic information like email, name, address for later installments, date of birth and phone number. This data is essential in order to provide users credentials to use our web-application.
\subsection{Login}
The main feature of our project is for each user to have unique database with significant data-structures and data transfer objects, that are unified amongst all users, these transfer objects provide all users whole access to the program and the back-end implementing it.
\subsection{Authentication}
Since we allow multiple users login, we generate a token that differentiates a user from another, this is necessary for the access of database and all other features of the application. For instance, a user needs to be identified to the system first in order to view his stream, visitors and unique data.
\subsection{Authorization}
The authentication token is passed to all the routes and the back-end handles the token to verify the user, thus he is authorized to access our features, those are two key features that are established for users' safety and data security.
\subsection{Password Hashing}
Every user has a password, this password is not stored in the database to ensure users' security. This one-way hashing method is essential to prevent hackers and malicious users from illegal access to the database, and even if they accessed it they won't be able to either get the password, and for the reset password with the user name they will have to access the user's email and get his password in order to know his randomly generated password, before he changes it, which we encourage users to change directly after it being sent.
\subsection{Data Change}
All users are allowed to change their data, only ones that are changeable, to facilitate their use of the program, in case a user forgets his password or changes his phone number or demands to change his email.
\subsection{Reset Password}
Additionally, users are allowed to reset their password in case they have forgotten it, in order to log in to the network, if they lost their password the are not prohibited from our service.
\subsection{Interaction With Users}
We handle sending emails to users in order to reset their password, or to notify them when a visitor is at their doorstep. This keeps users updated to our servers and have easy access to the Observa support team.
\subsection{Video Stream}
We provide the users with a real time update, as much as tech holds, to their doorstep view, to see who is visiting them and watch their doorway whenever they want to or feel unsafe or warned.
\subsection{Face Detection}
The stream is provided with models to detect people's faces as long as they are in the range of the camera. This enhances other features that are essential for the main course of the application.
\subsection{Visitors Recognition}
If visitors are labelled in the user's data base they are recognized, otherwise they are saved in the database for security matters.
\subsection{Managing Contacts}
Contacts are the visitors labelled in the user data, each visitor saved has a saved image in order to identify him later if he is to visit us again. Users may also label unknown visitors, add other contacts to the database with labelled attributes i.e name, image and relationship to the user. They can also delete an existing contact or even update his saved data.
\subsection{Visitors History}
Users can see the history of their recent visitors to know, who visited them and when, in case the user was not ready to check his email or the video stream along the day. This will be very useful to hardworking people who would like to check the list of their visitors throughout the day.
\subsection{Remember Me}
Once users are logged in to our network, they are remembered for a while, i.e if the user refreshes the page he is still logged in and he is still authorized to his endpoints and requests.
\subsection{Log out}
Users are allowed to logout even if they are logged into their profiles and their session time has not ended yer, since a user might have multiple accounts if he lives in a mansion, or he does have multiple homes and wants to check for his own home safety.
